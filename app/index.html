          In this game, you'll be playing against the computer in a fast-paced battle to see who can earn the most
          points
          within 30 seconds. To start the game, simply press the "Create Deck" button. You'll then be able to start
          battling the cards
          against the computer. <b> But be careful! </b><em> You must press the "play" button within 5 seconds!, or the
            computer will automatically win the round.</em> As you battle the cards, you'll earn points based on the
          cards
          you play. At the
          end of the 30-second time limit, the player with the most points wins the game. Good luck, and have fun!
