# Card-Game
So, I recently completed a project based on the War card game using vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS, with a focus on using OOP principles and classes, as well as grid templates. I'm really proud of how it turned out, and it was a great opportunity for me to develop my skills in JS, OOP, and CSS.

First, I used HTML and CSS with a grid template to create the basic structure and design of the game, including the card deck and game board. The grid template made it easy for me to position and align the different elements on the page, giving the game a clean and organized look.

Then, I used vanilla JS to implement the game logic, creating classes for the card deck, player hands, and game flow. Using OOP principles and classes really helped me organize my code and make it more maintainable and scalable.

As the game progresses, players take turns drawing cards from the deck and comparing them to see who has the higher value. The game keeps track of the score, and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

Overall, I had a lot of fun working on this project, and I feel like I learned a lot about vanilla JS, OOP, and CSS. It was a great way for me to challenge myself and grow as a developer, and I'm excited to continue building on the skills I developed through this project.
