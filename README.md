# Card-Game

I built a War card game project with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS.<br>
Using OOP principles and classes, I organized the game logic for the card deck, player hands, and game flow.<br>
The grid template in CSS helped create a clean and organized layout.<br>
I'm proud of the outcome and the opportunity to enhance my skills in JS, OOP, and CSS throughout the process.<br>
It was a fun and rewarding project, and I'm excited to continue growing as a developer.
